# RoM
공유 다이어리 어플리케이션 'RoM(Room of Memory)'

### RoM prototype on proto.io
Link to prototype: https://pr.to/W64YPO/

### How to use:
- For this medium-fi design, we used proto.io to prototype. The proto.io page emulates the iPhone screen and the computer mouse emulates the user’s finger.
- Proto.io highlights clickable areas; users can click on buttons, bars, etc. to navigate between pages.
- Tapping the back arrow take the user to the previous action.
- Tapping the home button take the user to the main page.(rooms page)
- Tapping the person icon take the user to the setting page.
- Tapping the plus button allow the user to write a new post on the day.
- Users can scroll down the screen to see multiple posts.

### Limitations:
- Room name and post contents are hard coded into this prototype. The real application would  give suggestions based on user inputs.
- Arrows in the vertical direction indicate that the contented could be scrolled
- through, but this scrolling functionality has yet to be implemented.
- The search field in various screens will allow for users to input text, but have yet to be implemented.
